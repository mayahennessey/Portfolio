                                <p> That one young mellow fellow
stands at a corner every morning.
He brings a yellow umbrella yet
it is never raining.
He wears a golden suit and
has slick blonde hair.
He waits for a bus to take
him to work.
</P>
<p>

That one young mellow fellow
likes to walk his cat.
He has a yellow leash and
picks up the business with a yellow bag.
He does not care how weird
it looks to the neighbors.
This is how he exercises on a
bright sunny day.
</P>
<p>
That one young mellow fellow
does not have many friends.
He knows what you are thinking
and you never have to tell him.
He does not make eye contact
and speaks with a lisp.
He is like a fortune cookie
but you never have to open him.
</P>
<p>
That one young mellow fellow
likes the color yellow.
He likes the way it gleams
even in the deep blue nights.
He will not change the way
he acts or looks.
For this is the lifestyle he chose,
and it is modeled after his favorite color.

Some are broken into pieces or
are maintained as one.</p>

<p>Every pair of tights I own has a hole in them.
They are the eyes to the

They are the patterns that break
my polished rosy tights.
They are the window to my hard work.</p>
<br>
<p>Every pair of tights I own has a hole in them.
My mother says they’re ugly
but I would disagree.
They are a work of art, a masterpiece.
So I wear them proudly
despite my mother’s request. </p> -->
